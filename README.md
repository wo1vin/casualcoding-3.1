## Dire Directions, Dear Developers
- To install, use the command `npm install`
- Create a `.env` file in config folder
- Add it to `.gitignore` file if you plan to deploy or push to GitHub
- Add the following as `key = value`:
  - PORT = 2121 (can be any port example: 3000)
  - DB_STRING = `your database URI`
  <!-- - CLOUD_NAME = `your cloudinary cloud name`
  - API_KEY = `your cloudinary api key`
  - API_SECRET = `your cloudinary api secret` -->
- To run the program, use `npm start`

Happy Coding!
